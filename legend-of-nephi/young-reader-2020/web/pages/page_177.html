Righteousness could not happen without wickedness. Likewise, wickedness could not happen without righteousness. Neither happiness nor misery. Neither good nor bad. All things must be compound (two opposites) in one. If the body were without opposites it would remain dead forever. It could have neither life nor death. It could have neither corruption nor incorruption. It could have neither happiness nor misery. It could have neither sense nor insensibility.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>

There would have been no purpose for life. No purpose in the end for the body&rsquo;s creation. This would destroy God&rsquo;s eternal purposes. This would destroy God&rsquo;s wisdom. This would destroy God&rsquo;s power. This would destroy God&rsquo;s mercy. This would destroy the justice of God.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>
