The members of the church of the Lamb of God were few, but they were spread throughout the world. Their dominions were small because the dominion of the <SPAN class="wicked">wicked one</SPAN>&rsquo;s church was so great. Members of the church of the Lamb of God were called <SPAN class="emph">saints</SPAN> of God. </div>
