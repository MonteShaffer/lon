I pondered what he had shared about his vision of the tree. I also pondered the things my father had explained. He spoke by the power of the Holy Ghost. He received this power because of his faith in the Son of God. The Son of God was this Messiah that will come. I wanted to see and hear and know these things for myself. <SPAN class="quote Nephi" data-person="Nephi">&ldquo;The power of the Holy Ghost is a gift from God to all those that diligently seek Him. This gift is given to all who diligently seek the Messiah. Yes, in times of old, this gift was given. In my time, this gift is given. In future times (such as when the Messiah will manifest himself unto the children of men), this gift will be given.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>
