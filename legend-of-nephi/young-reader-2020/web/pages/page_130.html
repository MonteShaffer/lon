These plates should emphasize spiritual things: both about the ministry of my people and the prophecies received from God. These smaller plates contain the more plain and precious truths. They are kept as a special record of instruction for my people who possess the land after me. They are also kept for other wise purposes. Purposes that God knows, but I do not. </div>

And both sets of plates should be handed down when I am gone. The larger plates from one leader to another. The smaller plates from one prophet to another. This tradition must continue until God commands otherwise. </div>

I proceed writing the precious truths on these smaller plates. I do so that the sacred things may be kept for the knowledge of my people. </div>
