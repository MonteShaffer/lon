I did construct it after the manner of Jehovah&rsquo;s temple built by Solomon. It did not have as many precious things as Jehovah&rsquo;s temple built by Solomon. As such, it could not be built exactly like Jehovah&rsquo;s temple built by Solomon. Nevertheless, the manner of construction was like Jehovah&rsquo;s temple built by Solomon. The workmanship of the temple we built for Jehovah was exceedingly fine. </div>
