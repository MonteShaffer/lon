Among my people, some will suppose they are not of worth. I will speak directly to them in this regard. Nevertheless, I know they will be of great worth to those that read these prophecies in the last days. In that day, they will understand these prophecies. I am writing this for their benefit. </div>

A few survived and were carried away captive to Babylon. </div>
