You which are of the house of Israel. Give ear to my words. The words of Isaiah are not plain to you. Nevertheless, they are plain to those filled with the spirit of prophecy. I give you a prophecy according to the spirit which is in me. I will prophesy according to the plainness which is in me. Yes, the same plainness I have had since I came from Jerusalem with my father. Behold, my soul delights in plainness. I speak plainness unto you, my people, that you may learn.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>
