They did murmur against their father. They complained often. They criticized him as a visionary man. They protested that he led them out of Jerusalem. That he made them leave the land of their inheritance. That he made them leave behind the gold, silver, and precious things. They accused him of leading them into the wilderness to perish. And they complained that Lehi did all this because of his foolish imaginations of the heart. </div>

They murmured because they did not understand God&rsquo;s plan. The God who had created them. </div>

They did not believe the prophets. They did not believe their father. They were like many of those in Jerusalem. Those in Jerusalem that wanted to kill Lehi. </div>
