You say he has used severe language against you. You say he has been angry with you. That language you felt was severe, it was severe because of the power of the word of God. God&rsquo;s power was in him. That which you call anger was truth. God&rsquo;s truth. Nephi could not restrain himself. Courageously speaking truth concerning your unrighteousness.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>
