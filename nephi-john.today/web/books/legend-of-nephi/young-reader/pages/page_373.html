I perceive you are still pondering these things in your hearts. It grieves me you do not understand. You would understand if you would pray. <SPAN class="quote Nephi" data-person="Nephi">&ldquo;Yes, the Spirit teaches a man to pray. You must pray. The evil spirit does not teach a man to pray. In fact, he teaches man that he must not pray.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>

Do not falter in this. Before you do anything (related to God) pray. Yes, pray to the Father in the name of the Messiah. Pray that God will consecrate your performance. Indeed that your performance will be for the welfare of your soul.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>
