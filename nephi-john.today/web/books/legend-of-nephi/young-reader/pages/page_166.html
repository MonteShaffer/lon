They will dwindle in unbelief. After receiving so many great blessings from God. After having a knowledge of the creation of the earth. A knowledge of the creation of all men. After knowing the great and marvelous works of God since the creation of the world. After having power given them do do all things by faith. After having all the commandments from the beginning. After having been brought by God&rsquo;s infinite goodness into this precious land of promise. Yes, in that day. The day they will reject the Holy One of Israel. The day they will reject their true Messiah. The day they will reject their true Redeemer. The day they will reject their God. In that day, God&rsquo;s judgments will fall upon them. His judgment will fall upon our seed.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>
