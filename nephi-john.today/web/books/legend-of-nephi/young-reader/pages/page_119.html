You are quick to do unrighteousness. You are slow to remember God. You have seen an angel. An angel spoke you. God has also spoken to you through His still, small voice. You no longer hear this voice. You are behond feeling. So God had to speak to you with his voice of thunder. Which caused the earth to quake as if it were to break apart.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>

By God&rsquo;s word, he can do more than merely have the earth quake. God can make rough places be smooth. God can make smooth places to be broken in pieces. If God wanted, He could completely cause the earth to cease to exist. God has this supreme power, yet you still harden your hearts?&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>
