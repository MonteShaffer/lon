Yes, a sore cursing. Because of their iniquity. They had hardened their hearts against God. They had become like flint. My brothers used to be white, exceedingly fair and delightsome. Now, they had adopted local traditions of painting their bodies black and their mouths red like the beasts of the forest. They had become dark and loathsome. As a result, my people were not interested in marrying these nonbelievers. </div>
