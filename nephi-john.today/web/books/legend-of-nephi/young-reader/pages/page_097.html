A person has days of probation to live according to his choices. After this life, this person will be judged by the works performed in the temporal body. The judgment may be a torment of the soul because of the things done with the temporal body. </div>

If one dies in wickedness rejecting spiritual and righteous things, this person will be cast off. If one&rsquo;s deeds have been filthy, the person must be filthy. Filthy things cannot dwell in the kingdom of God. If it were so, the kingdom of God would also be filthy. </div>

No unclean thing can enter into the kingdom of God. Therefore, there must be another place prepared for the filthy. A place of filthiness. </div>
