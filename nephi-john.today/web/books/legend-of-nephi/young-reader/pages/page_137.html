God has shown me spiritual things. (God had shown spiritual things to the prophets of old as well). I realize that without God&rsquo;s benevolence, I would have perished like so many have in Jerusalem. Even now, I expend significant spiritual energy pleading for those who are at Jerusalem. My pleadings physically weaken me, to a point that I can&rsquo;t stand. </div>

To the prophets of old, God showed them of the impending destruction of the kingdom of Judah. To the prophets of old, God showed them of our deliverance from this destruction. Evidence of these prophecies are written on the brass plates. </div>

I read to them the words of Zenos. I read to them many other teachings and prophecies engraven on the brass plates. I shared these things with my brothers that they may understand God&rsquo;s prophecies, even His prophecies of old. </div>
