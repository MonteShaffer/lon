Come to God, the Holy One of Israel. Remember that His paths are righteous. Behold, the way for man is narrow. But this way lies on a straight course to God. And the keeper of the gate is God, the Holy One of Israel. He does not employ a servant there. And there is no other way. This is the only gate. And He cannot be deceived. For God is His name.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>

But He will not open the gate for everyone. He will not open for the wise and learned in their own wisdom. The gates will not open for the rich who love their riches. He despises them. Unless they cast aside their riches and their own wisdom. Unless they consider themselves fools before God. Unless they come down into the depths of humility. God will not open the gate for them.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>
