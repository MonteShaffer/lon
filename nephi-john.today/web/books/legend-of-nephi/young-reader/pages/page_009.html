Lehi told the Jews they were wicked. Lehi also shared many of the things he saw and heard in his visions. He taught them things he read in the book. He taught them about the coming of the Messiah (Yeshua). He taught them that Yeshua would redeem the world. </div>

(Jews have a history of casting out, stoning, or killing the prophets of old.) They wanted to kill my father. But God protects those He has chosen with kind benevolence. God makes His chosen mighty. God gives them power to be rescued from danger and evil. All because of their faith. </div>
