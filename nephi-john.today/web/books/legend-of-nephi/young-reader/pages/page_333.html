For God only does that which is good for the children of men. God does things without cunning or disguise. And He invites all men to come unto Him. He invites them to partake of His goodness. And He does not deny anyone to come unto Him. All are invited. Black and white. Bond and free. Female and male. He even remembers the heathen. All are alike to God: the Jew and the Gentile.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>
