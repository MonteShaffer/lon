I know that if you follow the Son, then you will receive the Holy Ghost. Yes, follow the Son with full purpose of heart. Do not act with hypocrisy or deception before God. Act with real intent. Repent of your sins. Witness to the Father that you are willing to take upon you the name of the Messiah. Be baptized. Yes, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water as the Father commands. Then you will receive the Holy Ghost. Yes, receive the baptism of fire and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Then you will be able to speak with the tongues of angels. Then you will be able to shout praises to the Holy One of Israel.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>
