You cannot be mistaken. As God lives, I testify of these things. Yes the God that delivered Israel out of the land of Egypt. The God that gave Moses to heal the nation after they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents (<SPAN class="emph">nachash</SPAN>). (If they would look up to the [true] serpent (<SPAN class="emph">seraph</SPAN>) Moses had placed on a staff before them.) The God that gave Moses power to strike a rock and water would come forth. Yes, this God. Behold I say unto you, that God did these things. And as God lives, I testify that there is no other name given under heaven whereby man can be saved. That name is Yeshua the Annointed One.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>
