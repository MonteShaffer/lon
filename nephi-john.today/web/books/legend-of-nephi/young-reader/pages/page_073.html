The book contains the record of the Jews. The book includes the covenants of God, all of the promises He mad to the house of Israel. The book also includes many of the prophecies of the holy prophets. These prophetic writings were similar to the records we have on the brass plates. Our records are more comprehensive. Nonetheless, the book contains the covenants between God and the house of Israel. As a result, the book is very important and valuable to the Gentiles. </div>
