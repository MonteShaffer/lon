The same words that will be used to judge them in the last day. The words will be given to persuade and convince them of the true Messiah. Yes, the Messiah they rejected. The words will convince them that they do not need to look forward any more for another Messiah to come. For another will not come, except possibly a false Messiah which would deceive the people. For there is only one Messiah spoken of by the prophets. That Messiah is He who the Jews will reject and crucify.&rdquo;</SPAN> </div>
