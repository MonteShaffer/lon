Men orah is the polygenesis marker

Mormon ... Good's Good Love ... high mountain fresh waters, mythological mountains lakes (of the north) from which all creations came (10 friends).  ... 

Nephi's commentary on Canaanites.
Abraham from URU or from a Noah genealogy?  Abraham was promised Canaan.  His firstborn was?  Who should "own" the Levant?



Genealogy manipulations.  TPJS he tried to study as an unlearned man.  A marker.

Shem/Melquisedec 

bull/serpent as the earthly/heavenly form of God's son.


10 virgins parable... lamps or lampstands?

Laban (beheaded) ... Ananais.

Menorrah ... has the story of 10 in it.  

What is Andrew/Peter's name in Hebrew?  This has always been the answer.  If the "10" apostles represented the 10 forests invited to the garden party, they would not have had Hebrew names.  They would have been Black, Brown, Yellow, and White. (Hovind).... 

Nephi saw the "Sun" and "10 stars"... The Sun of Righteousness.



70 nations, 70 ... two by two is 35?

100 two by two, the number 8 as a reunion of M/F ... At-one-ment ... bring humanity back into its divided state through the God oath.

Wilderness can mean ocean.  

Two bulls, NET ... Isaiah ...

Nephi carves planks for ships is translated as idols.  Idolatry was the creation of wooden figurines, as the Queen Mother figurines were brass or metal of some sort being reshaped into a phallus.

If the MDE is altered, very likely all characters would reverse.  Herod may be a good guy?  Hasmoneans?

Pontius Pilate, known to be brutal, herein is not brutal.  Washes his hands, not his fault.  Oh, and Yeshua teaches "be good little citizens and pay your taxes".

Experiments with Bread for Queen Mother of Heaven.  Spelt and Almond flour (tried coconut, nonsensical). date-palm flower...   Pink/Black "Himalyan" salt.

Mount Horeb (Abraham)... mis-translation.  
Mountain of Mountains.
Mount of Olives ... Mountain of Almonds ...

KavaKava is not YerbaMate or Black Drink.  But it has a Egyptian marker in the double language.


Revelation(s) as a highly edited book.

7 churches.  Throwing Nicolaitans under the bus (Agape) who was a student of Stephen (stoned by Saul/Paul and others) who was a student of Peter.

Prophet = Spirit of Prophecy
City/Land of Enoch being 500 miles square or circular (would fit in the gulf of mexicon).  Height is nonsense.
12 stars and mother/dragon is an astrological thing.  Maybe of significance to anchor the general time of something.  The shift of processions of the equinoxes ... Taurus/Aries/Aquarius ... (going backwards).

Hiding 10, hiding Ox (bullock) sacrifice.  Recrafting Moses story to do so, likely dropping even the name from Moses-yah to Moses as it also has some marker/indicator.

Polynesia... chickens ... DNA (Jack Sulley fallacy) ... drift direction.

Add Titicaca information.  Inca stories of 10,000 balsams to the ring of fire.


Etupia ... Tupi ... Tupi's God ... Tupa ... God of Thunder and Lightnight 

Incan Temple with Sun Room (Gold), Moon Room (Silver), Rainbow Room, Thunder/Lightning Room ... 



cat's in the cradle (twin flame of Yeshua...) 
right hand ... save yourself ... 

 ... two bulls (Isa)... net 
silver spoon ... gold spoons 
little boy blue ... Judas Iscariot ... money ... hung from tree ... brain smashed and open on the ground ... 
man in the moon ... two blood eagles on the entrance of the temple ... 

12 days of Christmas ... O Tauntenbaum ... 
Ring Around a Rosie ... 

4+ GB, lost? file... or "sealed portion" ... LOL ...


Maybe Bountiful, Arabia was a sapling nursery of different trees.  And other seedlings.  I spent all the gold for seeds before I left, so Isaiah would say they went to a land where gold has no value.

What is the evolution of complaints by the brothers.  Are there any indications of complaining about gold being lost, then no longer making such complaints?  e.g., gold was recovered.  So they shifted their complaining that the people of Jerusalem were righteous?  Nephi killed, lied, and stole in six hours, it could be justifiable if this was their argument.

# was Yeshua 365/10 or 369/10 years old?  Doesn't align with my current timeline calculations, but?   Enoch age as marker, 369 Tesla.

# At-one-ment was to reunite the sexes universally.  To achieve this, Yeshua lost his twin flame.  His Hag Sophia.  She choose not to join Him in the Resurrection.  End of Times Wedding Party is the completion (teleois) of the At-one-ment... Yeshua reunited with Sophia. 

Of course, Yeshua would have the greatest love story every told.
# Claro que si ... what was influence of Old Tupi on Old Spanish?  Inquiring minds want to know.

# Uhbert swords in Northern Europe.  

# Everyone at once... E-town?  everything, everywhere, all at once

# Bukake japanese idea... ingest lots of flavors in the hair/eyes/mouth/skin ... where did that idea come from???

# Bitter vs sweet seed.  A taste test.  Maybe if a potential partner finds it sweet, the taste buds are a discernment tool to find twin flames or potential flames worth considering as a good match.

# Maybe the Essenes (bar or), tattoes on their palms, were the guardians of light after the event.  Maybe the Baptist survived and preserved/salvage what could be salvaged.  How would MDE, temple destruction, roman retaliation, GEM destruction, Yeshua/saints drop the sword, the appearance to "apostles" to ascension all occur in a timeline?

# Tarot card.  Cross leg to knee (maybe a nail threw knee and ankle)... With "4 mothers" ... Abba Maria... sorry about your ankle?

# Rod of Aaron (or substitute) was anal stauros?

# Carved into Flesh, what is written is written.  I have an idea, let's carve it off, throw it on the BBQ and make those who demanded it to be removed to eat it. - Pontius 





# Asked Pontius permission to retrieve the body.  Again PR to demonstrate who was in charge.  Pontius was likely dead.  Bodies thrown in the street and someone put them in the tombs.  Underground or above Sheol.

# Jacob seemed to be a weasel, but a ceremonial wrestling with Jehovah cleared him for the resurrection.  God of the living, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob.  Likely Abraham, Isaac could already do a stare down with the seven gates of Sheol (Pleides?) but Jacob needed an upgrade.  If voluntary, it does not have to leave you sore, maybe as soft as a breeze.

# Amazing what a jacuzzi bath can do.  JS was not opposed to rebaptism.  Maybe instead of Rameuptum we should uhem baptism.  JS's peers reminded him of the scripture "One Baptism"...


... AM ... energy is more grounded, has the moon-shift caused this.

Not worried about Isla, but son.

Parley P ... timeline for first vision... Pratt in Tennessee hung and castrated, but nothing to do with sex!

Thor's anvil.... making steel would be loud, if you are pounding it out (Nephi).

If he had the ability to generate electricity using eleectrostatic friction, he could get his finger's sparkle (Ragnorak).

## A rubber rod is charged negative by rubbing it with rabbit's fur. A lucite rod is charged positive by rubbing it with silk.

Tupi had little tricks of earth science to be nicknamed thunder/lightning ... useful marketing gimmick for marketing ... and to teach about the God of thunder/lightning ... [potential connection to Yeshua and his stick/drawing in circcles ... earth-science]

Hilarity of MCU... Love/Thunder ... Priesthood is eternal, except your mission where it is a limited time offer... LOL...

KAA ... this morning. sunken skull attribute? Not her, but clearly a connection.  Are these clues of other lives on this earth?  Natalya as Hagia?

Or are these cosmic links suggesting this is not the original simulation.  Comment to Micah "you will do so much better at this when it is your turn"?  The feeling at times that maybe everyone is going to jump up and shout surprise, like they are all playing me on something.


NOT left?  Misinterpreted by Romans to mean something else.  So they took the left eye with the spoon.  Odin gives up his left eye for "wisdom" where wisdom is Sophia?  Maybe it was a brutal choice to enable her to be quickly killed (third rib, left side) before the blood-eagle ritual.  Done posthumously to her.

Likely "casting lots" was betting game about which rib who have him cry out in pain.  Never crying out was nothing more than FU.  Ruach at its finest.  Showing and celebrating all of the emotions of humanity in the pain and angusih of the torture.

What intrigued Roman Caesars (Kaiser pronounced... Phil/Rubi-anna)... after 31 AD as possible clues into the MDE.  Or MLEs?  lol, maximum likelihood estimators.

Fortress of Herod?  Mastaaad???  Maybe it was a "secret effort" to support the MLEs until the Romans found out.  If Herod is a good guy, lots of possibilities to concsider?

Maybe Alexander the "Great" and his conquests were all intentional to generate the Greek Renaissance so that the library of Alexandria would exist.  What other things would the other 8-10 trees do in preparation.  The gifts of frankinsene, myrrh, gold all seem to be Kedar/Ishmael gifts.  Gifts within the house of Abraham offered by the firstborn as homage to Yeshua.

Eze 28, King of Tyre as annointed as a "king" ... demigod?  How far Lucifer has fallen, to the lowest depths of the pit.  The kings stand, what are you doing here.  He has no place even among the kings he deceived.  

Tombs/underground burial of the dead vs mauseleums of Latinos and Earthworks where above ground.  Round stones.  

David Whitmer had seer stone(s).  Final life story, visit by Mormon church for his manuscript.  This is "original" ... misunderstanding.  JS using Master Mahan Oaths for "good" ... beat the devil at his game.  An oath was made to not reveal the drafts/secret fragments of the BOM translation process.  David Whitmer was answering a different question.

Emma's son goes to SLC to ask question X, Brigham says ask "mom" about Y.  Brutal.

Emma-Karsen, HuaFa... Alejandra (lawyer)... LiLi hired over all British Indian options.

Movie, Count of Monte Cristo.  Language/events and order are clues.  Again another Caviell movie maybe more informative than the Passion..

37 + 5 = 42... damn hitchhiker.... The answer is 5.

37 years, 30 days.  Maybe minus 40 for uncleanness of mother, or minus 8 before presented in temple.  37,22 or 36,355?

Kevin, lay a snare with a trap exploiting nakedness of virtue, to test?
Something about "puang france" as well.  The stars arriving was clearly the beautiful blondes, but was it Karsen?  That is, are the starseeds planting trees the daughters of God from the stars.  Certainly the garden party could be labeled by some as a "galactic orgy" (Zeus in Thor's love/thunder movie", lol.

Lyran father is furious, can transgender me, not castrate me!  Very different things.

Motifs of barb wire, cow-stall enclosures, sled?  Mason wants to take the sled.

Knife for women... in the side.  Did Sophia stab Yeshua, left side, third rib so his blood eagle was posthumous.  Is the M/F story reversed?  Spoon (eye of Horus/Odin)... Knife (to a woman).  Maybe before Sophia's blood eagle, Roman's allowed them close to say goodby and with non-sharp knife, or shiv.  Or back of spoon, Yeshua dispatched Sophia/ the butter knife and spoon as opposite ends of the same tool.  The male/female.  

If Roman's are doing "bad" ... Ruach is flowing nonstop and a desire to disrupt their main event plans would be in full force.  Very different than the ascetic submission the PR tried to sell.  If the bet was X, Yeshua would in stubbornness, obstinance like a bull or bison, do NOT X!

Herod was healed at the waters... NOT operator... Bethsaida?  Maybe the major miracles of sight and healing were very prominent actors.  

What of Lazarus?

Mountain meadow massacre was not true blood atonement.  Seemingly only once it occurred because a man loved a wife and/or her sister?  

3 fingers, ohm...

heart of a dying star (Thor).

Trip to Montana, West Glacier, two eagles going a different way.  An eagle in MT last winter on arrival eating carrion.  Joel think eagles don't eat carrion.  The mighty eagles of my youth when the fish was abundant before the lake trout fiasco.  The single eagle yesterday while talking about this.  The blanket on the wall, two eagles.   The wings of two cherubs in the holy of holies and on the Ark of the covenant.  The lack of the word eagle very likely in the Masoretic texts.  QED.

Ezekial, story engraven on heart of stone.  Nicholasville "blind" ... imagery of two bulls in the street, but anchored to the traditional Revelations narrative.

No rest for the wicked (or weary).  Denzel ending, Book of Eli, resting at the end.

Eat drink and be merry, a few stripes.  what is that hedonic symbolism trying to teach us.

beauty for ashes

was Essenes a post-MDE attempt to create zion similar to Incas... a remnant... if so, what was the government/society that Yeshua created, where was it.  Egypt?

Yehsua the Egyptian... the warrior king?

medicine men... be healed with faith or herbs.  I forgot when the surgeon addendum was added to D&C 46?

MCU list of "zelph on shelf"... Jon Hamer, curator?

Ark of Covenant in America.  Would that demonstrate all historicity?

MCU is not worthy of unifying, inclusive meaning of "Mormon" as God's good love.  Mor-mon ... mon-or-ah.

Like America, Mormon has the double-entrendre contrast thanks to MCU.

Joel #17, catheter, flushed out... no need for kidneys in the resurrection...

Telsa pyramid 369, electromagnetism.  Did Joseph in Egypt know the "shock" trick?

Et tu brute.  Did Yeshua get the Roman centurions to kill Pontius.

In the middle of MDE, a centurion asks for help fo his daughter.  Yeshua grants the wish.  humanity is all of the emotions, feel the burn of anger, yet serve and love the innocent.

TTT movie.

2 girls, 1 boy... matt-sew-ee... Matthew butchered Lil-nail?  Lil-bet?

Colon-mbia neck-tie.... mount up like on EAGLES wings... prophecy of MDE?

V for vendetta.  #5, lol 

flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone... Is this a titicaca word pair... The flesh of all flesh, the bone of all bone.  ebeneben baribari?

enough is enough ... awnaf awnaf ... 

nehsher nehsher ... the eagles of all eagles...

natural man:  Pro 30:19 (BLB)

Eze 10:14, four faces... cherub/seraph, man, lion, eagle...

The universal At-one-ment caused a twin flame, division.  Rev 12:14 ... the woman given the two wings of a agreat eagle, she flew home to her place (Lyria), from the face of the serpent. ???

BLB eagle vs eagles ... 

ISA 40:31 ... star walking doesn't require oxygen or lungs?  resurrection is an upgrade, the training wheels (breath of life) is no longer necessary?

Jer 4:13

Math 24:28 / Luke 17:37  body, eagles ... 

Jer 4:29 ... the Roman retaliation to the storming of the temple and "assassination" of Pontius... 

bawkar ... first child of a mother, 1069.  Similar word to "cow"

Jer 4:31, the woman is travail/anquish "as-if" bring a child.  Cries herself, soul is wearied from mrdered ... "spread her hands" = blood eagle?  bewaileth = something about lungs... nephesh = breathing struggles (to open wide the soul, dead man walking)




Ani = I even I 
Anoki = I even the other I (ki being other?)
 Nephi = wind in the sails...
 
 Bette Midler, wind beneath my wings... blood eagle
 




Church of Christ, 2nd Ave West.  Cfalls.  Colon-mbia falls.

Isa 40 ... children will faint (ring around the rosie, and so on).  Main event was last verse, the blood eagle.

Nachash ... bronze serpent on a pole.... literally the stauros of Aaron and the half-human who lost his legs, his tailbone is flapping about like a snake.  Those that could look, would be saved.  Those that looked away would not?

Isa 41 ... ancient nation "chiefs"

41:19 (Bountiful [America], Arabia) is a tree nursery.

Ur ... to raise up (5782) ... URU ... the good people raised up...  

Deut 32 ... sheep, lambs, "rams" or Bashan (oaks were cows?), kindnes, oil, honey...  something hinkey.\

32:25 the Roman response...  void of purpose (counsel) ... of no value to me...  back to Isa 40 ... word network with eigenvalues.... difference engine to find words like "lehi" that are embedded in the deviations from Strong's...

wisdom = 2449, ka-kam ... double word/wilderness
oh be wise ... ka-ka 

woooop!  what does this mean.

Deut 32:30 ... is the baptist the survivor to collect the bodies and the records?  one chase a thousand; two put 10,000 to flight ...

is the "one" Pontius?  The "two" the blood eagle "couple"

Rock = God ...

vine/grapes ... families/children are dead as Sodom/Gomorrah?

Deu 32:39 similar to the voice of anger in 3 Nephi 8?

Deutoronomists edited/revised what they could of Zenock/Zenos prophecies, but those that seek, shall find.  

making of "sweet meat"... requiring no fire ... jerky (beef jerky) was likely tied to original khosher practices and sealing in the spirit of the animal past five days.  Sahpatin would use the sun to preserve fish.  Russians pickle everything.  Eat the spirit off the vine if possible, but if preserves are necessary, there are likely records of who to do it aligned with the spirit.

Holy Spirit Ruach defines humanness.  love and anger ... love and thunder is Ruach.  Not ascetism and monostacism.  To be human it to feel all of the emotions.

Relief soicty needs major comfort centers.  I wouldn't call this prostituded therapists, no medical manipulations of the brain, but the essence of empathy seems to be woman's work.

If we are in a simulation, maybe every iteration of i,j, k loop is a single pair, a twin flame at a time.  Very difficult for me to imagine that this is the first run of such ?At-one-ment?

Gordon gave the pinnacle talk once?  Woman, precious ruby.  Tossed too and fro.

# E-town ride, Skype delayed her "cat in the cradle message"

# One/Two had to have been little boy blue and the two cows.

If plural cows, one male/one female, is the plural "male"?


## Did JS outline Nephi had some understanding of electromagnetism before Mr. Farrady?  Interesting how the modern discovery is a function of the release of the words of Nephi...

Evidences, Karey the smell of the sea and salt... the boat caught its limit!

Other sheep, isles of the sea... I need to go and light their lamps.  lampara
