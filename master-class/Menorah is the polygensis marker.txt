Menorah is the polygensis marker

Nephi's commentary on Canaanites.
Abraham from URU or from a Noah genealogy?  Abraham was promised Canaan.  His firstborn was?  Who should "own" the Levant?



Genealogy manipulations.  TPJS he tried to study as an unlearned man.  A marker.

Shem/Melquisedec 

bull/serpent as the earthly/heavenly form of God's son.


10 virgins parable... lamps or lampstands?

Laban (beheaded) ... Ananais.

Menorrah ... has the story of 10 in it.  

What is Andrew/Peter's name in Hebrew?  This has always been the answer.  If the "10" apostles represented the 10 forests invited to the garden party, they would not have had Hebrew names.  They would have been Black, Brown, Yellow, and White. (Hovind).... 

Nephi saw the "Sun" and "10 stars"... The Sun of Righteousness.



70 nations, 70 ... two by two is 35?

100 two by two, the number 8 as a reunion of M/F ... At-one-ment ... bring humanity back into its divided state through the God oath.

Wilderness can mean ocean.  

Two bulls, NET ... Isaiah ...

Nephi carves planks for ships is translated as idols.  Idolatry was the creation of wooden figurines, as the Queen Mother figurines were brass or metal of some sort being reshaped into a phallus.

If the MDE is altered, very likely all characters would reverse.  Herod may be a good guy?  Hasmoneans?

Pontius Pilate, known to be brutal, herein is not brutal.  Washes his hands, not his fault.  Oh, and Yeshua teaches "be good little citizens and pay your taxes".

Experiments with Bread for Queen Mother of Heaven.  Spelt and Almond flour (tried coconut, nonsensical).  Pink/Black "Himalyan" salt.

Mount Horeb (Abraham)... mis-translation.  

KavaKava is not YerbaMate or Black Drink.  But it has a Egyptian marker in the double language.


Revelation(s) as a highly edited book.

7 churches.  Throwing Nicolaitans under the bus (Agape) who was a student of Stephen (stoned by Saul/Paul and others) who was a student of Peter.

Prophet = Spirit of Prophecy
City/Land of Enoch being 500 miles square or circular (would fit in the gulf of mexicon).  Height is nonsense.
12 stars and mother/dragon is an astrological thing.  Maybe of significance to anchor the general time of something.  The shift of processions of the equinoxes ... Taurus/Aries/Aquarius ... (going backwards).

Hiding 10, hiding Ox (bullock) sacrifice.  Recrafting Moses story to do so, likely dropping even the name from Moses-yah to Moses as it also has some marker/indicator.

Polynesia... chickens ... DNA (Jack Sulley fallacy) ... drift direction.

Add Titicaca information.  Inca stories of 10,000 balsams to the ring of fire.


Etupia ... Tupi ... Tupi's God ... Tupa ... God of Thunder and Lightnight 

Incan Temple with Sun Room (Gold), Moon Room (Silver), Rainbow Room, Thunder/Lightning Room ...
